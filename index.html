      <h2>Escape from reality</h2>
      <p>
        I often hear people say that they read to escape reality,
        but I believe that what theyâ€™re really doing is reading to
        find reason for hope, to find strength. While a bad book
        leaves readers with a sense of hopelessness and despair, 
        a good novel, through stories of values realized, of wrongs
        righted, can bring to readers a connection to the wonder of 
        life. A good novel shows how life can and ought to be lived. 
        It not only entertains but energizes and uplifts readers.

      <h2>Decamping</h2>
      <p>
       I think what we do is really, at times, a compliment thing. But at the end of
       the day it's so important that we make art for people that need to escape
       rality foe a second. That's what music has always been for me. It's been 
       for me. it's been a way to tap out of what's going on in my personal life.

      <h2>Fantasy</h2>
      <p>
        We don't create fantasy world to escape reality, we create it to be 
        able to stay. I believe we have always donw this, images to stand 
        and understand what otherwise would be intolerable.
